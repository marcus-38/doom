;;; Commentary:
;; This is my personal Emacs configuration. The file is tangled from a
;; literate org document where I try to document what each piece is for.
;; If you found my configurations you are free to use as you please, but
;; please read the whole thing before you do. I regulary commit my
;; configuration even though it is not working. Yes, I know, you shouldn't
;; do that but you have been warned.

;; Here be dragons

;; Code:

(package! spacemacs-theme)

(package! pulse)

(package! rustic)

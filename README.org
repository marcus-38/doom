This is my personal configuration of doom emacs. If you found it, don't use it. I normally push unfinished code to this git.

Here be dragons...

* One configuration file
See [[file:config.org][config.org]] for the source configuration file with some limited commentary. Work in progress...

** Generated files
Running =doom sync= in a terminal or =SPC h r r= in emacs generates the actual configuration files read by emacs:
- [[file:config.el][config.el]]
- [[file:init.el][init.el]]
- [[file:packages.el][packages.el]]
